# Introduction

## People Suck

## Decentralization is the Future

## Properties of Currency

There are 5 essential properties of currency.

1. Scarcity
2. Fungibility
3. Divisibility
4. Durability
5. Transferability

## Properties of Digital Currency

1. Order all transactions
2. Record transactions permanently

## Crypto Coins

We have all heard stories about Bitcoin millionaires and how rich you could have been if you bought $1000 worth of Bitcoin several years ago. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, and other alternative coins exist to serve different purposes.


## JavaScript (Node.js) and Cryptocurrency

This book covers essential components of cryptocurrency by showing examples in JavaScript. In fact, this could have been done with virtually any programming languages. Bitcoin is implemented in C++, Ethereum is in Go, and Cardano is in Haskell. We chose JavaScript because it is the modern language of Internet. JavaScript is used everywhere today from embedded systems to front-end applications.

As we build Blockchain and various forms of digital money, what we are ultimately going to do is building networks for transferring values. Blockchain, Merkle Trees and Decentralization are just for ensuring security and efficiency of the network. Originally built to serve the web applications, JavaScript is perfect for our goal.


## Basic Networks With JavaScript

We can write a whole book about web frameworks. But this is definitely not going to be our focus, as we want to learn about Blockchain. We are going to minimize the code needed for the implementation and trim all the unnecessary parts.
