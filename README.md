# From Digital Money To Blockchain and Cryptocurrency
Introduction to building your own Blockchain based Cryptocurrency in JavaScript


Some confuse the terminology 'Blockchain' with 'Cryptocurrency' because usually media draws no distinction between them.
Blockchain in itself is a really simple concept.
If you learned basic CS, you will understand that blockchain is no more than just a linked list with a hashmap.
Of course, cryptocurrency is complicated, but it is not due to blockchain.
Blockchain is just one of the many components why cryptocurrency became so powerful.
So we are going to cover the other major elements that make cryptocurrency work.

We are going to build a mini-cryptocurrency with minimal code.

After you read this article, you will:

* Understand high level overview of how blockchain works
* Understand major elements that go into cryptocurrency technology
* Implement your own cryptocurrency with proof-of-stake algorithm
